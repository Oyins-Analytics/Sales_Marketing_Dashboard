Marketing Sales Dashboard

The Marketing Sales Dashboard project provides an insightful analysis of marketing and sales data, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions. I meticulously cleaned the data using Microsoft Excel, employing data modeling, filtering, sorting, formulas, and pivot tables to ensure accuracy and clarity.
The dashboard features interactive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, conversion rates, and customer acquisition costs. Users can dynamically filter data to customize their views, enabling deeper insights into sales performance.
Overall, this dashboard serves as a vital tool for understanding marketing effectiveness and driving strategic business initiatives.
